              <p><span>Joel Black</span> HUGE thank you! Apparently I recently had bed bugs. No signs of them other than getting eaten alive between my shoulder blades. No live bugs, no fecal that I could see, no blood marks and even checked under the sheets
                just before dawn. Still no signs. But I knew I was getting bitten by something and it was happening during the night which was freaking me out to say the least. And oh my word do those bites itch like crazy!</p>
              <p>Bought 2 bottles of your product. Stripped the bed and washed linen in hot water. I sprayed the mattress and box spring all over (I know you said a light spray but I was nervous and sprayed EVERYWHERE). I had read that, like lice, it wasn't
                about being clean or dirty because I'm a little OCD on cleanliness. But I also read that bed bugs like to hide in the cracks of furniture, especially those that are old like curbside or thrift store furniture. Ding ding ding. That was
                the light. I have a renewed furniture shop and I am constantly bringing in old pieces. So that's where they came from. Now to rid of them.</p>
              <p>So I'm spraying the mattress, box springs, carpet, curtains and surrounding furniture. I do this 2 days in a row. My "bite marks" are healing and I haven't had any more bites since. So long story short, you have truly been my hero. Thank
                you for rescuing me without me having to empty my savings account and for your product to work so quickly and give me back my peace to go to sleep without worry of being a bug's buffet.</p>
              <p>Thank you. I will continue to buy!!!!!!</p>

          <p>The compounds in our product have undergone rigorous University laboratory testing by a specialized Entomology and Nematology department as well as consumer testing! Using BugShield<span class="bspro">Pro</span> you can be confident <strong>you're using a secret weapon bed bugs have no chance winning against.</strong>            </p>

          <img src="../assets/images/destroy-on-contact.jpg" alt="" class="imgright" />

          <p>The reason it's different from other solutions is because it uses a safe active ingredient to efficiently stop bed bug infestations.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Our ingredient list:</strong> Active Ingredients: 3% Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, 1% Sodium Chloride, 0.2% Citric Acid. Inert Ingredients: Water, Yeast, Urea, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate. Ingredients total 100%. Proudly manufactured
            in the US.</p>

          <p><strong>So how does it work?</strong> Its highly effective water-based formula with a safe active ingredient attacks and destroys bed bug's exoskeleton making it an incredibly effective solution <br/>without being toxic to humans and pets.</p>

            <p>This product worked like a miracle. I used it once and I haven't seen a sign of any bugs in my house since. This is a great product and I can confirm it worked for me. Keep putting it out there and advertise it. Some people may feel embarrassed
              by the bugs but they will not be sorry if they try this product. </p>

            <p>I purchased the product about a month ago and so far we have seen great results. We have tried many methods and many other over the counter products that only seem to work for a short time. We are going to continue using say bye bye for the
              next few months to see how the products continue to work and keep the bed bugs away. </p>

            <p>I worked in a hotel and I know first hand how tough it is to get rid of bed bugs and how expensive it can be. So when I got up on night to us the bathroom and found one on my leg I was freaked out. Looking for a way to rid myself of the pest
              for cheaper then what a professional company charges I found your site and thought I would give it a try. I couldn't treat till the weekend but I scanned the one bedroom that night. I found one and sprayed it died almost instantly. That
              weekend I sprayed both bedrooms. It has now been a couple of weeks had I have not seen a bug or any sign of a bug since. I am very happy with how the product preformed. I hope to never have another problem again but if I do I will not hesitate
              to order this product again. </p>

            <p>BugShield<span class="bspro">Pro</span> is the best product we've used in our home to get rid of nasty bed bugs! Works better than any product we've purchased in stores. Also great because it's completely safe for our children; no having to
              inhale horrible toxins! This product kills and eliminates bed bugs completely! Bought more just to be extra safe in protecting our family and home. Worth the price! Highly recommend to anyone who has a bed bug problem in their home. </p>

            <p>I just received my package. Although I have not started to treat the infested room I was "lucky" to spot a bed bug. After shaking the bottle well as instructed I sprayed the bed bug. With in seconds of contact the bug started to shake and
              convulse. But it seem to still be alive, so I sprayed it again. After about a minute or so the sucker was dead. I'm am glad to see that BugShield<span class="bspro">Pro</span> spray is effective as stated on the website and I look forward
              to clearing up my bed bug issue!! </p>

            <p>After trying some other products and home remedies, I was skeptical that this would work but after another sleepless night, I ordered it. How happy I am to report that it really does work! I now get a good night's sleep and am worry free.
              I used it twice a day for the first month and now spray once a day. There is no odor, it does not stain and it works. Congratulations for saving people hundreds of dollars in exterminating fees.</p>

            <p>There is only 2 different exterminators in out town that has the products to take care of these bugs. They did not want to come and deal with them. So they sold us their products so we could start to take control of the bugs. So we had found
              the nests and had gotten rid of it before the products arrived. The first product started but would not have gotten rid of the bugs. When your product arrived we had the nest out side but as we looked at them with your product we could see
              that there were still bugs alive. They were in the headboard of the bed. It was on a trailer headed for the dump,but we sprayed the live bugs. It killed them immediately. We sprayed the entire 3 bedrooms and so far we have not seen another
              bug. I was grossed out and I have sprayed more than was necessary. The only thing I would recommend is overnight shipping. </p>

            <p>I had previously tried another product, but found yours to be safer . Your guide was most informative. The others product was less expensive, but I like yours better. My husband has never been bitten, and we never even knew we had bedbugs
              until I had the bites. We live in a rural area and I just thought it was just another insect. I am looking forward to my next shipment to completely irradiate these beasts! Thank you for your help.</p>

            <p>I sprayed the bedbugs and it killed them on contact, just like you said it would. I was very pleased! I also put on the mattress and box springs covers I got from you. They seem to be gone but I will spray again in 1 week to make sure. I was
              very pleased when I read it would not be harmful to pets and humans. </p>

            <p>You guys are awesome! I've already recommended your product - the situation with our company's warehouse dude was dire and I needed something to insure he wouldn't drag bed bugs into the company! We'd have him Spray his shoes before entering

            <p>I have only made 3 or 4 orders from you. But I know enough that I have spread the word about your product because for some uncanny reason word of mouth has led at least 100 people in my direction. I tell them all the same thing, that your
              product works better than any other on the market and do not get duped as I did by Terminex or whomnever you see advertised on the television. I let them know that Say Bye Bugs did more for me in less than $100.00 than Terminex did for me
