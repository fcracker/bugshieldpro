If you have installed it in another language, the commands and options will probably have been translated into your native language. In that case, find the command with the similar name, the logical grouping will still be the same. p>All the images used in this helpfile assume the default settings. If you change any of these settings, you'll have to look for the other image instead, this is most noticable with the toolbar (the position of images will always remain the same). 
Also, when talking about the left and right mouse buttons, the logical left and right is meant. These are the same as the physical left and right mouse buttons in the case of a right-handed setup. However, if you have a left-handed setup you will probably have the buttons swapped so act accordingly. This means in general you do what you normally do for most actions, Notepad++ mostly follows the standard Windows application behavior. 
Likewise, the layout is discussed as it is displayed in a left-to-right order. On right-to-left systems (such as Hebrew) translated versions of Notepad++ can have the display order reversed, adjust accordingly as well.
This helpfile uses some markup to distinguish certain interface elements or interaction.
